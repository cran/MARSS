\details{

This function returns the conditional expected value (mean) and variance of the model one-step-ahead residuals.  'conditional' means in this context, conditioned on the observed data up to time \eqn{t-1} and a set of parameters.  

\strong{Model residuals}

\eqn{\mathbf{v}_t}{v_t} is the difference between the data and the predicted data at time \eqn{t} given \eqn{\mathbf{x}_t}{x_t}:
\deqn{ \mathbf{v}_t = \mathbf{y}_t - \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{x}_t - \mathbf{a} }{ v_t = y_t - Z x_t - a}
The observed model residuals \eqn{\hat{\mathbf{v}}_t}{hatv_t} are the difference between the observed data and the predicted data at time \eqn{t} using the fitted model. \code{MARSSresiduals.tt1} fits the model using the data up to time \eqn{t-1}. So
\deqn{ \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t = \mathbf{y}_t - \mathbf{Z}\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_t^{t-1} - \mathbf{a} }{ hatv_t = y_t - Z xtt1 - a}
where \eqn{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_t^{t-1}}{xtt1} is the expected value of \eqn{\mathbf{X}_t}{X_t} conditioned on the data from 1 to \eqn{t-1} from the Kalman filter. \eqn{\mathbf{y}_t}{y_t} are your data and missing values will appear as NA. These will be returned in \code{residuals}.

\code{var.residuals} returned by the function is the conditional variance of the residuals conditioned on the data up to \eqn{t-1} and the parameter set \eqn{\Theta}.  The conditional variance is 
\deqn{ \hat{\Sigma}_t = \mathbf{R}+\mathbf{Z}_t \mathbf{V}_t^{t-1} \mathbf{Z}_t^\top }{hatSigma_t = R + Z_t Vtt1 t(Z_t)}
where \eqn{\mathbf{V}_t^{t-1}}{Vtt1} is the variance of \eqn{\mathbf{X}_t}{X_t} conditioned on the data up to time \eqn{t-1}. This is returned by \code{\link{MARSSkf}} in \code{Vtt1}.

\strong{Standardized residuals}

\code{std.residuals} are Cholesky standardized residuals. These are the residuals muliplied by the inverse of the Cholesky decomposition of the variance matrix of the residuals: 
\deqn{ \hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1/2} \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t}{ hatSigma_t^{-1/2} hatv_t. }
These residuals are uncorrelated. 

The interpretation of the Cholesky standardized residuals is not straight-forward when the Q and R variance-covariance matrices are non-diagonal.  The residuals which were generated by a non-diagonal variance-covariance matrices are transformed into orthogonal residuals in MVN(0,I) space.  For example, if v is 2x2 correlated errors with variance-covariance matrix R. The transformed residuals (from this function) for the i-th row of v is a combination of the row 1 effect and the row 1 effect plus the row 2 effect.  So in this case, row 2 of the transformed residuals would not be regarded as solely the row 2 residual but rather how different row 2 is from row 1, relative to expected.  If the errors are highly correlated, then the Cholesky standardized residuals can look rather non-intuitive.

\code{mar.residuals} are the marginal standardized residuals. These are the residuals muliplied by the inverse of the diagonal matrix formed from the square-root of the diagonal of the variance matrix of the residuals: 
\deqn{ \textrm{dg}(\hat{\Sigma}_t)^{-1/2} \hat{v}_t}{ dg(hatSigma_t)^{-1/2} hatv_t}, where 'dg(A)' is the square matrix formed from the diagonal of A, aka \code{diag(diag(A))}. These residuals will be correlated if the variance matrix is non-diagonal. 

\strong{Normalized residuals}

If \code{normalize=FALSE}, the unconditional variance of \eqn{V_t} and \eqn{W_t} are R and Q and the model is assumed to be written as
\deqn{ y_t = Z x_t + a + v_t}
\deqn{ x_t = B x_{t-1} + u + w_t}
If normalize=TRUE, the model is assumed to be written
\deqn{ y_t = Z x_t + a + Hv_t}
\deqn{ x_t = B x_{t-1} + u + Gw_t}
with the variance of \eqn{V_t} and \eqn{W_t} equal to I (identity).

\code{residuals.marssMLE} returns the residuals defined as in the first equations. To get the residuals defined as Harvey et al. (1998) define them (second equations), then use \code{normalize=TRUE}.  In that case the unconditional variance of residuals will be I instead of R and Q.  Note, that the `normalized' residuals are not the same as the `standardized' residuals.  In former, the unconditional residuals have a variance of I while in the latter it is the conditional residuals that have a variance of I.
