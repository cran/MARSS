\title{ Kalman Filtering and Smoothing }
\description{
  Provides Kalman filter and smoother output for MARSS models with (or without) time-varying parameters. \code{MARSSkf()} is a small helper function to select which Kalman filter/smoother function to use based on the value in \code{MLEobj$fun.kf}.  The choices are \code{MARSSkfas} which uses the filtering and smoothing algorithms in the \link[KFAS]{KFAS} package based on algorithms in Koopman and Durbin (2001-2003), and \code{MARSSkfss()} which uses the algorithms in Shumway and Stoffer. The default function is \code{MARSSkfas()} which is faster and generally more stable (fewer matrix inversions), but there are some cases where \code{MARSSkfss()} will be more stable and \code{MARSSkfss()} returns some values that \code{MARSSkfas()} does not.
}
\usage{
MARSSkf(MLEobj, only.logLik=FALSE, return.lag.one=TRUE, return.kfas.model=FALSE, 
           newdata=NULL)
MARSSkfss(MLEobj)
MARSSkfas(MLEobj, only.logLik=FALSE, return.lag.one=TRUE, return.kfas.model=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ MLEobj }{ A \code{\link{marssMLE}} object with the \code{par} element of estimated parameters, \code{marss} element with the model description (in marss form) and data, and \code{control} element for the fitting algorithm specifications.  \code{control$debugkf} specifies that detailed error reporting will be returned (only used by \code{MARSSkf}).  \code{model$diffuse=TRUE} specifies that a diffuse prior be used (only used by \code{MARSSkfas}). See \link[KFAS]{KFS} documentation. When the diffuse prior is set, V0 should be non-zero since the diffuse prior variance is V0*kappa, where kappa goes to infinity.}
  \item{ only.logLik }{ Used by \code{MARSSkfas}.  If set, only the log-likelihood is returned using the \link[KFAS]{KFAS} package function \code{\link[KFAS]{logLik.SSModel}}.  This is much faster if only the log-likelihood is needed. }
  \item{ return.lag.one }{ Used by \code{MARSSkfas}.  If set to FALSE, the smoothed lag-one covariance  values are not returned (Vtt1T is set to NULL).  This speeds up \code{MARSSkfas} because to return the smoothed lag-one covariance a stacked MARSS model is used with twice the number of state vectors---thus the state matrices are larger and take more time to work with. }
  \item{ return.kfas.model }{ Used by \code{MARSSkfas}.  If set to TRUE, it returns the MARSS model in \link[KFAS]{KFAS} model form (class \code{\link[KFAS]{SSModel}}).  This is useful if you want to use other KFAS functions or write your own functions to work with \code{\link{optim}} to do optimization.  This can speed things up since there is a bit of code overhead in \code{\link{MARSSoptim}} associated with the \code{\link{marssMODEL}} model specification needed for the constrained EM algorithm (but not strictly needed for \code{\link{optim}}; useful but not required.). }
  \item{ newdata }{ A new matrix of data to use in place of the data used to fit the model (in the model$data and marss$data elements of a \code{\link{marssMLE}} object). If the initial \eqn{x} was estimated (in \code{x0}) then this estimate will be used for \code{newdata} and this may not be appropriate. }

\details{
For state-space models, the Kalman filter and smoother provide optimal (minimum mean square error) estimates of the hidden states. The Kalman filter is a forward recursive algorithm which computes estimates of the states \eqn{x(t)} conditioned on the data up to time t (\code{xtt}). The Kalman smoother is a backward recursive algorithm which starts at time T and works backwards to t = 1 to provide estimates of the states conditioned on all data (\code{xtT}).    The data may contain missing values (NAs).  All parameters may be time varying.

The expected value of the initial state, x0, is an estimated parameter (or treated as a prior).  This E(initial state) can be treated in two different ways.  One can treat it as x00, meaning E(x at t=0 | y at t=0), and then compute x10, meaning E(x at t=1 | y at t=0), from x00.    Or one can simply treat the initial state as x10, meaning E(x at t=1 | y at t=0).  The approaches lead to the same parameter estimates, but the likelihood is written slightly differently in each case and you need your likelihood calculation to correspond to how the initial state is treated in your model (either x00 or x10).  The EM algorithm in the MARSS package (\code{\link{MARSSkem}()}) provides both Shumway and Stoffer's derivation that uses tinitx=0 and Ghahramani et al algorithm which uses tinitx=1.  The \code{MLEobj$model$tinitx} argument specifies whether the initial states (specified with x0 and V0) is at t=0 (\code{tinitx=0}) or t=1 (\code{tinitx=1}).

\code{MARSSkfss()} is a native R implementation based on the Kalman filter and smoother equation as shown in Shumway and Stoffer (sec 6.2, 2006).  The equations have been altered slightly to the initial state distribution to be to be specified at t=0 or t=1 (data starts at t=1) per per Ghahramani and Hinton (1996).  In addition, the filter and smoother equations have been altered to allow partially deterministic models (some or all elements of the Q diagonals equal to 0), partially perfect observation models (some or all elements of the R diagonal equal to 0) and fixed (albeit unknown) initial states (some or all elements of the V0 diagonal equal to 0) (per Holmes 2012).  The code includes numerous checks to alert the user if matrices are becoming ill-conditioned and the algorithm unstable.  

\code{MARSSkfas()} uses the (Fortran-based) Kalman filter and smoother function (\code{\link[KFAS]{KFS}}) in the \link[KFAS]{KFAS} package (Helske 2012) based on the algorithms of Koopman and Durbin (2000, 2001, 2003).  The Koopman and Durbin algorithm is faster and more stable since it avoids matrix inverses.  Exact diffuse priors are also allowed in the KFAS Kalman filter function.  The standard output from the KFAS functions do not include the lag-one covariance smoother needed for the EM algorithm.  \code{MARSSkfas} computes the smoothed lag-one covariance  using the Kalman filter applied to a stacked MARSS model as described on page 321 in Shumway and Stoffer (2000). Also the KFAS model specification only has the initial state at t=1 (as x(1) conditioned on y(0), which is missing).  When the initial state is specified at t=0 (as x(0) conditioned on y(0), which is missing), \code{MARSSkfas} computes the required E(x(1)|y(0)) and var(x(1)|y(0)) using the Kalman filter equations per Ghahramani and Hinton (1996).  
 
The likelihood returned for both functions is the exact likelihood when there are missing values rather than the approximate likelihood sometimes presented in texts for the missing values case.  The functions return the same filter, smoother and log-likelihood values.  The differences are that \code{MARSSkfas()} is faster (and more stable) but \code{MARSSkf()} has many internal checks and error messages which can help debug numerical problems (but slow things down).  Also  \code{MARSSkf()} returns some output specific to the traditional filter algorithm (\code{J} and \code{Kt}).

A list with the following components (m is the number of state processes). "V" elements are called "P" in Shumway and Stoffer (S&S eqn 6.17 with s=T).  The output is referenced against equations in Shumway and Stoffer (2006); the Kalman filter and smoother implemented in MARSS is for a more general MARSS model than that shown in S&S but the output has the same meaning.  In the expectations below, the parameters are left off, so E[x | y] is really E[x | theta, y] where theta is the parameter list.
